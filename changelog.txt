v0.5.6:
- FIX: Fails to load when using it together with mods that try to ModMagicNumbersFileAdd a non existent file.

v0.5.5:
- FIX: Make compatible with NG+ again

v0.5.4:
- Add automatic compatibility with mods that change the biome map. (Dependent on mod authors not using weird syntax...)

v0.5.3:
- Game should load much faster now due to a file being shipped pre-generated instead of generating it on the fly on startup everytime.

v0.5.2:
- Minimap now gets hidden when game is paused.

v0.5.1:
- FIX: Added 2 more biomes for Noita 1.0.

v0.5.0:
- Improved performance (hopefully) by only updating changed areas and when more than 11 areas need updating at once, splits the updates over multiple frames to reduce lag spikes at the cost of a little flickering.
- Added new biome colors for 1.0.
- Added compatibility with commonifier mod.

v0.4.0:
- Increased subpixel count to 3x3.
- Added a border.

v0.3.0:
- Divided each area into 2x2 subpixels for more accurate tracking!
- Removed the lookahead which would reveal areas the player can see. Defeats the purpose of a tracker when it reveals something you haven't actually been to.

v0.2.0:
- Improved performance by reworking the way the map is drawn
- Increased map size by 1 block, is 11x11 now instead of 10x10

v0.1.0:
- First release
