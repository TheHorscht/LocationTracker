Adds a rough minimap to the top right that shows the area around you and tracks where you have been.

You can resize and scale the minimap after unlocking it by clicking on the lock button. (This feature can NOT work while a gamepad is connected!)
To move it, click anywhere on the map and drag it.
To increase resolution or scale it, switch between zoom and resolution mode after unlocking and then drag the corners and edges.
Your changes will be saved once you hit lock again.

You can also change the settings in the mod setting menu located in the games options menu.

WARNING: Too high resolutions will cause lag! See what works best for you.
